			Kolibri is a forthcoming educational app created by Learning Equality. It makes top-notch online learning content, such as Khan Academy videos and CK-12 Flexbooks, available offline and accessible via smartphone or tablet. Kolibri hosts many different types of media: videos, podcasts, quizzes, and textbooks. Thus, smooth transitions between content items are crucial in order to create an immersive experience for learners. 
			<br><br>
			My job, along with my partner, was to propose layouts for the aforementioned media types.  We began with competitive analysis, created low-fidelity wireframes, then made high-fidelity mockups in Sketch.

		<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="project-page-subcontent" id="kolibri-compana">
		<div class="project-page-shit">
			We analyzed different video players, edtech sites, podcast sites, and text-based mediums to find the best qualities and recurring patterns.  We took tons of quizzes about topics we barely remember from high school, read many, many news articles, and watched lots of videos.  I focused on text and audio, while my partner focused on videos and quizzes.  I examined the layouts and styling of text-heavy sites such as The New York Times and Medium. I also looked at e-book readers and PDF readers to determine useful functionality.  For audio, I looked at both music players (such as Spotify and SoundCloud) and podcast apps.

			After our competitive analysis, we had a list of features that were important, and an idea of commonly used layouts.  We began making paper prototypes to determine what would best serve Kolibri.  We were able to work within the existing brand guidelines for Kolibri, including use of the existing icons and navigation patterns.  Personally, I get a lot of value from drawing the layouts of competitors as well; it helps me get a feel for how screen space is used.

			The first problem that we encountered as we moved into Sketch was designing for different screen sizes.  Kolibri is meant to be used  Kolibri will be used on everything from mobile phones to tablets to desktop computers, but often not on the newest models.  We were initially overwhelmed trying to consider what would work for all devices.  In the spirit of “mobile first,” we decided to create smartphone-sized mocks first, then scaled for desktop. 
			<br><br>
			We used Marvel to make our screens interactive (because we both have the maximum number of free InVision prototypes).  I also coded some rudimentary text styling guidelines, just to give a better idea of how textbooks would look and feel.  One thing that stood out to me is just how different text feels on a small screen: a two-page handout (with pictures) is more than six screen lengths tall.  In other words, an easily skimmed chunk of text feels much more onerous to read when digitized.  I realized it was important to include a means of navigating within the textbooks, in order to give learners a sense of place and to reduce scroll fatigue.

		<h3>Challenges</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="project-page-subcontent" id="kolibri-challenges">
		<div class="project-page-shit">
			Navigation presented a challenge that we’re still grappling with.  For some types of media, like quizzes and textbooks, including an app bar at the top of the screen fits with Kolibri’s existing layout.  However, videos and podcasts were more problematic because of their fullscreen layouts.  The point of fullscreen is to allow the learner to focus only on the content, hiding other information like descriptions.  This is valuable for immersion, but makes it difficult to transition between content items (for example, from a video on factoring numbers to a quiz about factoring numbers).  
			<br> <br>
			Throughout our design process, we kept asking ourselves “what do learners know?”  As American college students, we have a very different perspective on the world from learners in, say, rural Guatemala.  Actions that make sense to us might be alien to our audience.  There’s a tradeoff between visual simplicity and clarity that we had to explore.

			Working with Learning Equality has been a fantastic experience so far.  Even as an intern, it was easy to become part of the community, which made me much more comfortable with asking for help and feedback.  My partner was also phenomenal, and I’m happy with what we produced.  I’m excited to see what happens with our designs, and where Kolibri goes in the future.
