			GetRead was created as part of a UI/UX class at UC San Diego.  I was part of a three-person development team for a mobile app.

			We knew that we had to focus our app around storytelling, so we decided to focus on books.  Something that stuck out to us was the frequent regrets expressed by college students about reading as many books as they used to.  As a result, we wanted to focus on making it easier for students to check out books. 
			<br>
			Through our interviews (conducted on college students age 19–22), we found that none of our interviewees read books during the academic quarter, aside from books assigned for class.  Leisure reading was relegated to school breaks, if it happened at all.  We also found that the main campus library at UCSD, Geisel Library, is rarely used to check out books other than textbooks.  As a result, we chose to focus on connecting students to interesting books in Geisel Library.

			At first, we came up with prototypes that catalogued all the books in Geisel Library and organized them by topic keywords.  Users would be able to input their interests and be shown a list of books relevant to these interests.  After this initial round of prototyping, we were dissatisfied.  We felt that this approach was focused much more around books than it was around users. 
			<br>
			We went back to the drawing board, while still holding on to the idea of books as an underutilized resource.  We also wanted to create more opportunities for interaction between people.  We came up with a Tinder-esque app that would show books instead of people.  The books that users swiped through would be recommendations from their friends, books that other people thought their friends would enjoy.  We wanted to tap into the powerful connection created when one person lends a book to another.

			When I started this project, I had only rudimentary knowledge of HTML and CSS, and barely any experience with JavaScript (let alone any libraries).  Since I had more experience with art and user research, most of my early work was devoted to creating storyboards and paper prototypes, and with testing our prototypes on potential users.  Once we started developing, I helped with the basics of our layout.  I made some icons and contributed to aesthetic decisions, but our databases and other backend were handled by a teammate.  I also presented our app in a mock pitch session.

			The main qualm that haunted my group throughout the process of making our app was the fear that we were off the mark.  We weren’t really sure that people would even want to be connected through books; while sites that cater to communities of book lovers (like Goodreads) exist, we could also see that the user base seemed to be small.  The very fact that not many people read for pleasure seemed to attest to the fact that we were doomed to fail.

			GetRead was my first foray into designing with a group.  I enjoyed working with my group members; I felt that we could have critical, yet respectful discussions about our design decisions, and that we were all committed to producing a good result.  Even though our final design is by no means beautiful, I value the process that my group and I went through in order to create it.
