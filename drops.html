			November 2016 – December 2016 <br>
			As part of a three-person team, I helped to create a prototype for a music app.  This project was completed over the course of three weeks.

		<h3>User Research & Problem</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="project-page-subcontent" id="drops-research">
		<div class="project-page-shit">
			We began by interviewing nine students, all of whom use music streaming apps on their phones.  About half of the students use Spotify, while the other half use SoundCloud.  Some students also use other apps, like Amazon Prime Music and Google Play Music.  We asked users about their listening habits, their playlist usage, and what they like/dislike about the apps they use.  
			<br><br>
			Many students reported discontent with the variety of music that was offered on their platform.  Unfortunately, we can’t solve that problem.  Other students were annoyed by music suggestion features (e.g. “Discover Weekly” on Spotify), saying they preferred to follow the recommendations of other people, especially their friends.

		<div class="project-page-shit">
			It was clear that people value other people’s opinion on music.  Many of our interviewees said that they get recommendations for new music by looking at what their friends have been listening to.  We inferred that it would be valuable to take a social-based focus, and make it easy to see the activity of other users, in the vein of SoundCloud. 
			<br><br>
			We also found that almost all of our interviewees value playlists as a way of organizing their music.  Playlists are not only a mere means of organization, but also a means of curation, a way to make a statement about an artist, a time, or a feeling.  We wanted to prioritize playlist creation and sharing in order to further personalize user’s experience in sharing and discovering new music. 
			<br><br>
			We wanted to use a feed approach, similar to SoundCloud or 8tracks, because it makes it easier to see what other users are listening to.  We also wanted to incorporate Spotify’s playlist creation flow, since it invites users to browse for music to add, instead of forcing users to build a playlist off of a song.  
			<br><br>
			Finally, we wanted to focus on user’s profiles.  One of our principles was that people value their friends’ taste in music; thus, we wanted to make it easy to see tracks and playlists that users have liked.  We emulated Instagram’s layout for our profiles, because we like how clean and well-organized it is.

			I drew all our paper wireframes, in part because I think better on paper.  We knew that we wanted to produce all the key screens for the app, and we knew the general layouts we were emulating for each.  For the smaller details, like how to display a song as opposed to a playlist, or the exact links on the profile page, I tried to present similar screens from different apps (sometimes music apps, but other social apps as well, like Tumblr and Instagram) as a point of comparison.  Once we collectively decided on details, we distributed the paper wireframes and recreated them in Sketch. 
			<br><br>
			Another groupmate took the lead on making the digital prototype, because she has much more experience with Sketch than I do.  With her help, I was able to produce much higher-quality wireframes than I would have been able to on my own.  I helped make some of the icons, and helped with logo design and styling.

			While we may not have broken the mould of what makes a music app in any significant way, I’m proud of what we accomplished.  This was my first experience with using Sketch, and my first significant experience with InVision.  I definitely benefited from the expertise of my group members, and I feel that I was able to learn a lot with their guidance.
