			November 2016 – December 2016 <br>
			As part of a three-person team, I helped to create a prototype for a music app.  This project was completed over the course of three weeks.

<!-- 2. User Research -->

		<h3>User Research</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="project-page-subcontent" id="drops-research">
		<div class="project-page-shit">
			We began by interviewing nine students, all of whom use music streaming apps on their phones.  About half of the students use Spotify, while the other half use SoundCloud.  Some students also use other apps, like Amazon Prime Music and Google Play Music.  We asked users about their listening habits, their playlist usage, and what they like/dislike about the apps they use.  
			<br><br>
			Many students reported discontent with the variety of music that was offered on their platform.  Unfortunately, we can’t solve that problem.  Other students were annoyed by music suggestion features (e.g. “Discover Weekly” on Spotify), saying they preferred to follow the recommendations of other people, especially their friends.
			<br> <br> 
			To prepare for our redesign, we analyzed three music apps: Spotify, SoundCloud, and 8tracks.  We studied their layout, architecture, and interactions.  While no app is wholly better than the others, they do have different audiences, which shows in the most streamlined features.  Spotify has the most mainstream focus of the apps, and prioritizes browsing.  SoundCloud has a more niche audience, and allows more interaction with tracks, such as a time-based commenting feature.  Finally, 8tracks revolves solely around sharing playlists, and uses a unique tag-based system to organize playlists.  We kept our findings in mind as we progressed into ideation.

		<h3>Ideation</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="project-page-subcontent" id="drops-ideation">
		<div class="project-page-shit">
			It was clear that people value other people’s opinion on music.  Many of our interviewees said that they get recommendations for new music by looking at what their friends have been listening to.  We inferred that it would be valuable to take a social-based focus, and make it easy to see the activity of other users, in the vein of SoundCloud. 
			<br><br>
			We also found that almost all of our interviewees value playlists as a way of organizing their music.  Playlists are not only a mere means of organization, but also a means of curation, a way to make a statement about an artist, a time, or a feeling.  We wanted to prioritize playlist creation and sharing in order to further personalize user’s experience in sharing and discovering new music. 
			<br><br>
			We wanted to use a feed approach, similar to SoundCloud or 8tracks, because it makes it easier to see what other users are listening to.  We also wanted to incorporate Spotify’s playlist creation flow, since it invites users to browse for music to add, instead of forcing users to build a playlist off of a song.  
			<br><br>
			Finally, we wanted to focus on user’s profiles.  One of our principles was that people value their friends’ taste in music; thus, we wanted to make it easy to see tracks and playlists that users have liked.  We emulated Instagram’s layout for our profiles, because we like how clean and well-organized it is.

			I drew all our paper wireframes, in part because I think better on paper.  We knew that we wanted to produce all the key screens for the app, and we knew the general layouts we were emulating for each.  For the smaller details, like how to display a song as opposed to a playlist, or the exact links on the profile page, I tried to present similar screens from different apps (sometimes music apps, but other social apps as well, like Tumblr and Instagram) as a point of comparison.  Once we collectively decided on details, we distributed the paper wireframes and recreated them in Sketch. 
			<br><br>
			Another groupmate took the lead on making the digital prototype, because she has much more experience with Sketch than I do.  With her help, I was able to produce much higher-quality wireframes than I would have been able to on my own.  I helped make some of the icons, and helped with logo design and styling.

		<h3>Challenges</h3>

	<div class="project-page-subcontent" id="drops-challenges">
		<div class="project-page-shit">
			The longest argument we had over the design of Drops was over the organization of the profile page.  We had already decided that focusing on the user profile was something we wanted to do, and we knew what elements we wanted to include, but we were split on how to organize it.  Based on the layouts of other social media apps such as Instagram and Spotify, there was precedent for putting different tabs on the profile.  We wanted to avoid using a hamburger menu, since we felt it would be better for users to have an idea of what other functions were possible.  We also had to balance visual clutter (and thus number of tabs) with clarity.  
			<br> <br>
			We wanted to create a distinction between playlists/songs created by the user and playlists/songs reposted from other users.  We ultimately felt that this information could not be adequately expressed with icons alone.  We also went back and forth over the necessity of a separate “likes” section, instead of separate “playlists” and “songs” sections that would encompass both uploaded/reposted content.  In the end, we decided that having a standalone likes section was important because many of our interviewees said they try out music that their friends are listening to.

			While we may not have broken the mould of what makes a music app in any significant way, I’m proud of what we accomplished.  This was my first experience with using Sketch, and my first significant experience with InVision.  I definitely benefited from the expertise of my group members, and I feel that I was able to learn a lot with their guidance.
