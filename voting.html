			April 2016 &ndash; June 2016 <br>
			Our task was to analyze a problem from a human-centered design perspective.  Since the California primaries were approaching, we decided to tackle the issue of voter turnout in college-age adults.  We were swamped by the amount of information and ambiguity attached to our problem.  Ultimately, we created items that could be used for a social media campaign, though the success of these items is not easily measured.

		<h3>User Research & Problem</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="project-page-subcontent" id="voting-research">
		<div class="project-page-shit">
			We already knew that low voter turnout was a problem, but we didn't know where to start in order to address it.  Numerous studies and articles have highlighted the problem of low voter turnout in college-age adults.  Apathy is often cited as a factor, based on the perception that college students don't care about politics enough to vote.  Logistical issues, such as registering to vote, can also be barriers for college students, since many college students live away from home.  
			<br><br> 
			We conducted an online survey of 106 students and asked them about their past and intended voting habits.  From our survey, we saw that many students had never registered to vote before, and that the students who registered to vote would not necessarily follow through on voting.  These ideas were echoed in our expert interviews.  We talked with leaders in student political organizations, and also with two full-time staffers for the Bernie Sanders campaign. 
			<br>
			One of our experts mentioned that many groups focus on voter registration, since registration is the first hurdle between being a non-voter and being a voter.  As a result, we looked for ways that could encourage students to register to vote.

			We wanted to come up with something testable, instead of proposing any major systemic overhauls.  We turned our attention toward social media, since social media use among college-age adults is very high.  One particular app that interested us was Snapchat, since it has widespread use among young adults, and very little use by other age groups. 
			<br><br>
			I spearheaded paper prototyping of our various geofilter ideas, and also vectored the designs in Photoshop.  In addition, I went through Snapchat's geofilter creation process.  The ideas shown in the paper prototypes were based on insights from our expert interviews. 
			<br><br>
			There were other ideas that were not as easily communicated in a geofilter, such as statistics about voting.  I made some of these ideas into posters.  We printed a few copies of the posters and observed students walking past them on campus.

		<h3>Testing & Prototyping</h3>

			We implemented these geofilters in conjunction with Voterpalooza, a voter registration effort on campus.  The goal of the "Why I Vote" filter was to encourage students to talk about their democratic involvement. Based on expert interviews and user surveys, my group intuited that people vote for a variety of different reasons, and we wanted to spark conversations around those reasons. The "Uncle Sam" filter was meant to be more fun.  While neither filter generated significantly more views or uses than the other, it was a good experience for me as a designer. 
			<br><br>
			The "representation" poster was inspired by an anecdote from one of our expert interviews, who said that showing people the numerical weight of their vote does serve to encourage people to vote. It has a more emotional appeal, which was received well in feedback sessions. The "time" poster was meant to show people that voting is a quick activity that can easily fit into one's day. 
			<br><br>
			We tested refined versions of the posters by taping them in public areas on campus and observing passersby. None of the posters were interacted with very much, though some people did take the tear-off strips at the bottom.

		<h3>Challenges</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="project-page-subcontent" id="voting-challenges">
		<div class="project-page-shit">
			Despite our best efforts, we recognized that there was no way to measure or ensure follow-through.  There was no way of knowing if each person who saw our geofilters thought about it, and no way of knowing if each person who took a tear-off strip actually went and voted when the primaries rolled around. This is a challenge that all civic engagement efforts face, and one that nobody has found a way to transcend. 
			<br><br>
			We also faced an internal problem: my group was not very invested in our topic, or even our project.  It was a constant challenge to continue ideating, prototyping, and testing when the same few people were coming up with ideas.

			This project taught me a lot about group dynamics.  It's challenging to try to spark motivation and inspiration in others, and isn't always worth it.  I do feel that our end product was negatively affected by reluctance and lack of vision.  If I were to do this project again, I think it would help to have a more narrowly defined goal; instead of "increase voter turnout in college students," focus on a specific part of the process, such as voter registration, and find a tangible way to improve that process.
