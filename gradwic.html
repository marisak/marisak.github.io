			January 2017 – March 2017 <br>
			I had the opportunity to redesign the website for Graduate Women In Computing at UCSD, a student organization dedicated to creating a supportive community within computing-related fields at UCSD.  I worked along three other students to conduct everything from user research to wireframing to building the actual website.  I took on a mostly visual design-related role, working on the site visuals and on new branding for the organization 
			<br> <br> 
			GradWIC’s old website wasn’t serving them at all; they had no clear visual identity, and very little information on their goals or what they do.  In redesigning their website, we wanted to develop a clear visual identity for them, in order to help them recruit new members and find sponsors. 
			<br><br>
			The final site can be viewed <a href="http://ashtiani.io/187b/">here.</a>

		<h3>User Research and Competitive Analysis</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="project-page-subcontent" id="gradwic-userresearch">
		<div class="project-page-shit">
			We began by examining the shortcomings of the old website.  The main pitfall was the scarcity of information: there was almost no information about the club’s events or achievements, and no information about how to join.  There wasn’t even contact information.  
			<br><br> 
			In order to find out what information would be most valuable to users, we interviewed people in three different groups: potential members, potential partners, and current members.  We predicted that each of these groups would have slightly different sets of needs, but with some core similarities.  
			<br><br>
			The most urgent need that users had was information about the organization.  They wanted to know about goals, about past events, and about how to connect with GradWIC.  Meanwhile, GradWIC’s officers wanted to be able to direct site visitors to their Facebook page and email list, since they’re far more active via those platforms.

		<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="project-page-subcontent" id="gradwic-compana">
		<div class="project-page-shit">
			For our competitive analysis, we looked at the sites of other women in computing organizations, other student organizations, and professional sites focused on diversity.  We were particularly looking at their layout and branding, to see how they were communicating information about themselves.  
			<br><br>
			We were especially drawn to sites with strong, clear call-to-action elements, and a consistent visual identity.  I also looked for logos that could serve as inspiration for GradWIC’s new logo.

		<h3>Prototyping</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="project-page-subcontent" id="gradwic-prototyping">
		<div class="project-page-shit">
			After all of our initial preparation, we moved into prototyping.  We decided to use a single-page layout for the site, in order to convey as much information as possible with minimal clicking.  Since events are one of the most compelling things that our client does, we wanted to show their events directly from their Facebook page, and show their photos as well.  Finally, we wanted to use a clean, friendly color scheme based around the color purple. 
			<br><br>
			We created our initial prototypes with pen and paper, and ran them by our client.  With their blessing, we moved into Figma for high-fidelity prototyping.  We chose to use Figma because it allowed everyone in our group to work together at once, instead of volleying Sketch files back and forth.  I spearheaded the creation of the paper and digital prototypes, and also used InVision to make our hi-fi prototypes interactive.  I also developed some different logo designs during this stage.

		<h3>Development</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="project-page-subcontent" id="gradwic-development">
		<div class="project-page-shit">
			We used a Bootstrap template as the base for our site, and added two custom-made elements: a calendar of events and a photo gallery, both from GradWIC’s Facebook page, and built on Facebook API.  Two of my groupmates spearheaded the development of the site; I was still working with visual design. visual simplicity and clarity that we had to explore.

		<h3>Challenges and Reflection</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="project-page-subcontent" id="gradwic-reflection">
		<div class="project-page-shit">
			One of our major challenges was how to showcase GradWIC’s past events.  Our initial vision was to use the group’s pictures in a gallery, under the header “Past Events.”  However, since we were feeding the pictures directly from Facebook, we ran into the issue of showing too many similar images, and of showing visually unappealing low-quality images.  We ultimately decided to show a timeline with selected pictures from specific events, instead of rehashing every past event. 
			<br><br> 
			Our client was fantastic: they were very easy to get in touch with, and provided us with lots of copy and resources.  I was glad to have the opportunity to do so much visual design, on top of the user research role that I’ve filled in past group projects.
